Design of ConceptNet 5.5:

- [ ] Use standardized language codes in Wiktionary forms, or maybe remove that database?
- [x] Fix dependencies for conceptnet5.vectors: sklearn? pandas?
- [ ] Querying an assertion gives an 'edges' list that links to itself -- remove '@id' from the top level?
- [x] Wiktionary links should be ExternalURLs, not sources
- [ ] better API example on front page
- [ ] Remove "archa√Øque" context

ConceptNet 5.6 perhaps:

- [ ] Nodes should have labels that are stored separately from their edges
- [ ] Relabel vague nodes like "someone" and "something"
- [ ] Infer things from verb phrases
- [ ] Higher weights on monolingual things, lower weights on uncommon languages
