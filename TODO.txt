Design of ConceptNet 5.5:

- [x] link the API responses (fix Pygments order)
- [x] Don't stem things on the way in
- [x] Figure out how to keep more Verbosity
- [x] Coarsen Wiktionary using etymologies
- [x] Handle 'sw-maps' correctly, no proliferation of N-triples, no double-escaping
- [x] Store the index in a reasonable constant database
- [x] Use the blacklist when making assertions
- [ ] Use symmetrical relations
- [ ] Use JSON-LD when possible
- [ ] Optionally build ConceptNet vectors in build process
- [ ] Automatically test ConceptNet vectors

ConceptNet 5.6 perhaps:

- [ ] Nodes should have labels that are stored separately from their edges
- [ ] Break down the and-or trees into more machine-readable structures

Cleaning up the data:

- [ ] Relabel vague nodes like "someone" and "something"
- [ ] Infer things from verb phrases
