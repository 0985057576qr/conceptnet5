Design of ConceptNet 5.5:

- [x] link the API responses (fix Pygments order)
- [x] Don't stem things on the way in
- [x] Figure out how to keep more Verbosity
- [x] Coarsen Wiktionary using etymologies
- [x] Handle 'sw-maps' correctly, no proliferation of N-triples, no double-escaping
- [x] Store the index in a reasonable constant database
- [x] Use the blacklist when making assertions
- [x] Build ConceptNet vectors in build process
- [x] include word2vec and GloVe inputs in raw/
- [x] Automatically test ConceptNet vectors
- [x] Build vectors using less than 16 GB RAM
- [x] fix 'FormOf' links to self
- [x] Try new lemmatizer as part of Numberbatch
- [x] Break down the and-or trees into more machine-readable structures
- [x] Use symmetrical relations
- [ ] Use standardized language codes in Wiktionary forms
- [ ] Remove "obsolete", "archaic", "dated", "rare", "archa√Øque" contexts when other contexts exist
- [ ] Higher weights on monolingual things, lower weights on uncommon languages

ConceptNet 5.6 perhaps:

- [ ] Nodes should have labels that are stored separately from their edges
- [ ] Relabel vague nodes like "someone" and "something"
- [ ] Infer things from verb phrases
