{{en-noun|~}}

# {{context|uncountable|lang=en}} A chemical, found at [[room temperature]] and pressure as a clear liquid, having the formula H₂O, required by all forms of life on Earth. From a linguistic point of view it can be argued that H₂O exists in three states; water is one of them and is by definition liquid. Frozen water is called ice (though there are other frozen compounds known as ice they are given specific descriptions; e.g. dry ice refers to frozen carbon dioxide.) Ice alone refers to frozen water. Water vapor has various names, none of which is water. One can request a glass of water and not expect to receive a glass of ice or container of water vapor.
