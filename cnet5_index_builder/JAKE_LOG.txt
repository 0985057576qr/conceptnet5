1)run multiwriter scripts to take raw data of different formats from cnet5-raw-data and place standard json files in cnet5-json

2)run flat_json_to_csv.py to fill cnet5-csv with csv's

3)run flat_assertions.py to create larger json files that are compilations of the other json files

4)take json files from 1) and 3) and index them in solr

5) create tar.gz files and send to enemity so that they can be downloaded by whoever

scp from new-caledonia to the lab computer:
digitial-intuition@digitialintuition-Inspiron-620:~/ConceptNet5$ scp -r jvarley@new-caledonia:/Users/rspeer/code/conceptnet5/import/*  cnet5-raw-data/

good resource for recursive make:

CORE is just all the csv's concatenated together

#Work Log
###########################################

######################FROM MONDAY OCTOBER 1st
#I did the following
1) copied all off the files from new-caledonia onto this machine
2) made makefiles for raw_reverb and raw_wordnet
3) made makefile for raw files that recursively makes reverb and raw_wordnet

#next steps: 
1) finish up all of these raw_make files.  They all produce outputs left in the data folders
2) write next set of make files to process information from the data folders

######################From Friday OCTOBER 5th
#I did the following
1) made makefiles for dbpedia, globalmind, verbosity, wiktionary 
2) reorganized so that all raw data sets have data and raw_data folder
3) made make commands to create csv's for all data sources

#next steps:
1) conceptnet4 data has no makefile yet, need to make one, and figure out how to run it
2) need to figure out how to run flat_assertions.py and where I want to put those .json files
3) can probably start getting rid of some of the data_copy folders

#######################From Tuesday October 9th
#I did the following
1) started conceptnet_zh makefile, throws error though
2) got rid of data_copy folders

#next steps:
1) ask lots of questions
2) need to move ENV inside of ConceptNet5

#######################From Wednesdat October 10th
#I did the following
1) added to git
2) installed mecab, so read_globalmind.py now runs correctly
3) read_verbosity.py had an incorrect method signature, now runs correctly

#next steps
1) still need to fix Django DB erros, someone has a patch,
	Django 1.4 can support multiple DB's 1.3 could not.
2) change flat_assertions.py to build from all the smaller csvs

#######################From Friday October 12th
#I did the following
1) reverted back to django 1.3 this fixed read_zh.py

#next steps
1) working with flat_assertions.py to just take all the smaller .csv files,
having trouble with second part of this conditional, it is never true, think it just needs
to be removed

if uri != 'uri' and context == '/ctx/all':


#######################From Monday October 15
#I did the following
1) fixed read_conceptnet4.py it was having issues with memory and django
2) make command to build tar.bz for all the json files that go into solr

#next steps
1) post .tar.bz to somewhere
